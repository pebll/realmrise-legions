# Realmrise Legions

## Plan of this repo

This repo will contain a simple implementation of a tactical turn-based combat game. It will take place on a hex grid with simple terrain and units.

The core idea is that on each hex, a player has a legion, that is a group of units. Similar to Civ 5, for example archers have 10 little archer units depicted. But here, each unit is an independent element. It has its own health, attacks, and abilities. Grouping them together will create a legion.

The goal of this project is implement a proof of concept in Godot, that will create a little sandbox framework, to test interactions, UI, and general flow of the system.

I will clearly set goals for the V1 of this projects, with clear ToDos and clear ToNOTDos. More information can be found in `docs/`.
