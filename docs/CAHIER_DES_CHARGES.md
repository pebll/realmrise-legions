# Cahier des charges

This "Cahier des charges" will define everything that must and must not be done in the in order to reach the V1 goal of this project.

## General

Main guidelines:

- Godot Engine will be used
- Logic should be completely separated from visuals
- Chat should not write any code, with the exception of minimal refactorings

## Logic

### Core elements

- Hex map (more in MAP.md)
- Units (more in UNITS.md)
- Legions (more in LEGIONS.md)
- Combat (more in COMBAT.md)

### Testing

TODO: need to flesh this out
How to do testing? only test the logic?

## Visuals

### Assets

- Hex tiles (Generated by AI)
- Units (TinyCreatures spritesheet)
- UI (?)

### Effects / Additional assets

- Banner / Color for distinguishing realms (?)
- Projectiles if having ranged attacks (?)

All animations should be made by "procedually" by transforming the sprite position, orientation and proportions.

- Idle (squish and squash)
- Move (hopping?)
- Attack (stomp forward?)
- Hit (full white shader)
- Death (?)

## UI

- Selectable legions (colorful border (white) shader?)
- Info panel about units/legions/(tiles) (?)
- Simple menu (?)
- Tile/legions highlights, for moving, targeting.. (?)
